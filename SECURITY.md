# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to the maintainers with:

- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide a mitigation
or fix timeline after triage.

## Supported versions

Until versioned releases are established, security fixes are applied to the
default branch only.
